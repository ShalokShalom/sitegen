## Method Types

Plugins provide methods to different parts of the site generation pipeline. The
method types are:

* **template helpers**: available in any template file (html, markdown, etc).
 Typically cosmo functions.

* **site helpers**: available in the `site.moon` initialization function.

* **command line helper**: available as an action in the command line tool,
 `sitegen`.

Plugins can also change other aspects of the pipeline, for example, the
[Pygments](#pygments) plugin adds a pre-renderer to all markdown files which
let's you specify code blocks in a special syntax.

## Available Plugins

### Feed

Provides a site helper called `feed` that triggers a feed to be written from a
MoonScript file when the site is written. First argument is source, second is
destination.

```moon
feed "my_feed.moon", "feeds/feed.xml"
```

The feed file must return a table of feed entires:

```moon
-- my_feed.moon
date = require "date"
return {
  format: "markdown"
  title: "My Site's Title"
  {
    title: "The First Post"
    date: date 2011, 11, 26
    link: "http://example.com/my-post"
    description: [[
      The things I did.

      * ordered pizza
      * ate it
    ]]
  }
}
```


When rendering each entry, if a key is missing the entry, it will be searched
for in the root. This lets you set defaults for entries.

The `format` field is special. If it is set to `"markdown"` then all
descriptions will be rendered to html from markdown.

### Deploy

Provides site helper `deploy_to` and a command line helper `deploy`.

`deply_to` is used to configure where the site should be deployed to, it takes
two arguments, a host and a path. This can be done in the initialization
function:

    ```moon
    deploy_to "leaf@leafo.net", "www/mysite"
    ```

Deploying is done over ssh with rsync. It uses the command `rsync -arvuz www/
$host:$path`.

Assuming everything is configured correctly, the site can be deployed from the
command line:

    ```bash
    $ sitegen deploy
    ```

The deploy command line helper will only deploy, it will not build. Make sure
you build the site first.

### Indexer

Provides a template helper, `index`, that indexes the current page based on
headers. It scans the html for header tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) and inserts
anchors inside of them. It then renders the tree of headers to a list, with
links to the anchors.

An example page with a header hierarchy. The index rendered at the top:
    
    $index

    # My Title
    ## Sub-section
    ## Another Sub-section
    ### Deeper
    # Upper Level
    ## Cool

### Pygments

Provides new syntax for markdown rendered files. The syntax lets you describe a
code block that should be highlighted according to a specified language.

For example, to highlight Lua code in a page:

    ```lua   
    local test = function(...) 
      print("hello world", ...)
    end

    test("moon", 1, 2, 3)

    ```

The generated code does not have the colors embedded, only html tags with class
names. Colors can be added in a stylesheet.

This plugin requires that the [Pygments command line
tool](http://pygments.org/docs/cmdline/) is installed.

### CoffeeScript

Provies a template helper, `render_coffee` that lets you embed compiled
CoffeeScript into the page from an external file. CoffeeScript must be
installed on the system for this plugin to work.

In some page:

    $render_coffee{[[my_script.coffee]]}

It will produce `script` tags embedded with the resulting JavaScript.

### Analytics

Provides a template helper, `analytics`, that lets your easily embed the Google
Analytics tracking code. Takes one argument, the account code as a string.

In some page:

    $analytics{[[UA-000000]]}

### Dump

Provides a template helper, `dump` that dumps the contents of a variable.
Will pretty-print tables. Useful for debugging.

In some page

    $dump{title}

## Plugin Lifespan

The lifespan of a plugin is started by registering a plugin using
`sitegen.register_plugin()`

* The plugin is registered...
  * `on_register` class method called if exists
* The site is created...
  * If the *plugin class* has field `type_name`, plugin is saved as an
    aggregator for that type. (may be a list of types)
  * `on_site` class method called if exists, passed in site instance
* The site is prepared to be initialized from function...
  * The *plugin class* is checked for field `mixin_funcs`, which is an optional
    list of function names in the class that are inserted into the site scope.
    The functions are guaranteed to be called with *plugin class* as first
    argument
* `write` is called on the site...
  * for every page...
  * Page is checked for an `is_a` meta field, if it exists and matches one
    of the aggregator types mentioned above, `on_aggregate` is called on the
    corresponding *plugin class* with the page instance as the argument
  * The page is written (rendered)...
    * template helpers are extracted from the plugin if it has a
    `tpl_helpers` field. If there are helpers, the plugin is instanced. The
    constructor is passed the `tpl_scope`. All the `tpl_helpers` inserted
    into site scope automatically, and are guaranteed to be called with
    *plugin instance* as first object
  * `write` class method is called if exists

### Terminology

**site scope**: the object that represents the function environment that is used
when running the initialize function.

**template scope**: the object that holds all the fields available to any
template rendered for that page. It is made of, in order, the page meta data,
the site's user vars, and finally the template helpers.
